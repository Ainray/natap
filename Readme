Introduction:
        This script helps you to create a wireless-AP on Linux laptop (I use it as server.)
    and local LAN behind the Linux sever by NAT.

        My setting on Debian gateway have three sets of rules:

            * Disallow incoming connections to eth1 (the external network interface
            * Allow outgoing packets from the LAN (via eth0 and wlan0
            * Allow established connections to return."

        In my case, I have three interfaces, one Ethernet with Internet connection
    (not directly, but provided by my network adminstrator. So do not be confused 
    that why my Internet IP is an private IP. I also have the second removable 
    usb-Ethnernet to share Internet with my Windows desktop because it has a two
    displays which convient to enjoyment and do some works. I also use it as a 
    terminal of my Linux server. In addtional, my Linux server has a wireless card,
    I use it as an AP to share Internet with my cellphone Huawei P10 and ipad.
    I use isc-dchp-server to get my Linux to a DHCP server of the shared WIFI
